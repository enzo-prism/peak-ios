# Peak Privacy Policy

Peak is designed to be private by default. Your surf sessions are stored locally on your device using on-device storage. We do not require accounts, and we do not send your data to a server.

## What we collect
- No personal data is collected by the app.
- No analytics or tracking SDKs are used.
- No data is transmitted off your device.

## Optional support contact
If you choose to contact support, you may share information in your message (such as device details or screenshots). This information is used only to respond to your request.

## Changes
If this policy changes, we will update this file and the in-app documentation.
